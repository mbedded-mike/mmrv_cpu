# mmrv\_cpu

My implementation of RV32I ISA

## behavioral\_simulation

Requirements:

* GNU/Linux

* verilator 5.010 (or newer)

* GNU Make 4.x

* g++ 12.x

* GNU Binutils 2.x (mainly *as* and *objcopy*) for **riscv32-elf**

Optional:

* gtkwave


Steps:


1. Clone the repository

2. cd into the repository's main directory

3. ``mkdir waveforms``

4. ``make``

5. Now all of waveforms generated by all of the testbenches in the project are present in /waveforms directory


## milestones

[ ] Multicycle CPU design

[ ] Pipelined CPU

[ ] Branch predictor

[ ] Out-of-order execution support
